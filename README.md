# Crop Protection



# About the Idea
Our farmers work hard all day long over the year to yield a healthy batch of crop which brings about enormous benefit to them as well as the economy at large. However, diseases and pests take a heavy toll on agricultural crops causing severe loss to the farming community including the market. This can be overcome with the help of an efficient disease detection system for crop protection.

A well-maintained and well-managed web portal that can detect the type of disease, insect, or pest the crop has been affected with. Looking at the plant type and farmer's location, required information about the crop, its health, insects or diseases affecting it, and suggested remedies will be provided. Additionally, a contact of nearby Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) centres will be provided for further help.

Using image processing and data on crop diseases, pests, etc. as identified and documented by various National Agricultural Research Systems, the portal will provide an easy solution to various crop related problems. This will help farmers realise the problem immediately, saving their crops as well as avoid unnecessary use of pesticides.

Certain key features outlining the project are:
- A friendly easy-to-use portal for farmers
- Easy implementation through smart phone
- Judicial use of pesticides
- A huge save for both the farmers and the economy
